In many cases, important information can be extracted from the development of a sensorâ€™s behavior over time. 
Since a discrete Bayesian Network cannot capture this temporal information A standard discrete Bayesian Network cannot capture this temporal information, 
and modeling numerical states directly would complicate the representation , a Dynamic Bayesian Network offers a solution. 
It can represent the connections and relationships not only between different variables, but also between sensor readings 
across consecutive timestamps.
