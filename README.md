Based on the project task, I selected an equipment, which is a rolling mill and created a dataset with three types of sensors, each monitoring different aspects of the equipment. The first sensor measures vibration, which helps detect potential roll surface damage. The second sensor measures pressure, indicating possible hydraulic leaks. The third sensor is a flow meter, which identifies blockages in the cooling channels.
The main idea is that when these sensors detect values exceeding some predefined thresholds, an intermediate alarm is triggered. This allows for timely intervention before the equipment suffers severe damage or a complete breakdown. What we want is predictive maintenance, which is done only when needed but also before the severe damage occurs.

To this end, I trained a Bayesian Network using a labeled dataset, where the sensor types are represented as discrete variables indicating the state of the machine. The sensor readings in the dataset are already averaged, since for this specific purpose the time factor is not considered. Therefore, each row of sensor readings represents a specific state of the equipment, either normal operation or one of the identified fault causes.

For the maintenance actions, I defined three options for each cause, starting from the least demanding intervention and progressing to the most effort-intensive one. To evaluate and prioritize these actions, I computed their weights by considering the main criteria: maximizing OEE and minimizing spare part costs. In the first step, weights were assigned to these criteria, and in the second step, weights were determined for each alternative maintenance action.

Lastly, with the help of the calculated weights, TOPSIS is used to determine the most suitable maintenance action based on the defined goals. Depending on the answer from the inference step, the corresponding cause is identified, and the dictionary of maintenance actions is consulted. Each action is then mapped to its position in the evaluation matrix, which represents alternatives A, B, and C. Based on this mapping and the TOPSIS ranking, the method selects the action that best contributes to the objectives, such as maximizing OEE and minimizing spare part costs.
